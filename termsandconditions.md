# Terms of Service

_Last updated on July 28, 2024_

I’m not big on formality, but sometimes it’s best to have a few simple things written down so that we’re all on the same page.

By paying a Development Consulting invoice issued by Meredith Matthews (referred to as the Consultant, me, or I) , you agree to the policies and terms contained in this document.

## Billing and Project Terms

For any given project, I can bill in one of three ways:

### Hourly
One-off projects will be billed at $200 per hour, billed to the half hour, I include all meetings to determine task scope and time spent coordinating via email in billable hours (retroactively if necessary), and I expect a 50% down payment before work begins. Does not include time spent on extensive non-interactive deployments. All tasks will be agreed upon and estimated beforehand, and any additional requests from the client will go into a separate estimate. If, in the course of completing tasks, it is discovered that excessive unaccounted-for time needs to be spent to complete the tasks, I will contact you, explain the problem, and if necessary re-negotiate the agreement

### Retainer
I offer retainers that come in blocks of 20 hours for $3400, paid up front, for longer, ongoing work. Time is billed in 6 minute increments like lawyers do, meetings are inclusive but not retroactive, and hours never expire. Tasks and time will be tracked on a Trello board. 20 hours represents my maximum productivity in a week, therefore you may buy more than one block at a time but you may not spend more than 20 billable hours in any calendar week. I plan one status meeting a week for updates and new work, and an unbilled wrap-up review at the end, if you haven't decided to purchase more time.

### Consulting
My monthly subscription rate is $7500, paid in advance. You get unlimited time and tasks, but I will restrict meetings as tightly as possible, preferably limited to one regular status meeting a week with stakeholders. Most communication in this tier should be via email. For monthly consulting, we start with an extensive kickoff meeting to figure out what tasks and projects need to be done, and ongoing work will be tracked and documented on a Trello board.
 

## Strategic Consulting, Audits & Roadmapping

You get unlimited asynchronous access to me via our agreed upon communication channels. My responses may include written documentation, recorded videos or screencasts, code examples, and more.

I’m available to…

-   Identify expensive bottlenecks, hidden issues, and potential problems with your site.
-   Put together a reports with actionable next-steps on how to fix any issues.
-   Review works-in-progress.
-   Answer questions, both strategic and technical.
-   Recommend tools and processes.
-   Share emerging best practices.
-   Serve as a fraction team lead or Principal Developer.

Responses time will vary based on the complexity of the questions and whether or not I need to do additional research to provide you with a complete response. If a response will take more than a few days, I’ll let you know ahead of time.

## Training

Team training can include a variety of topics, and can be mixed-and-matched to meet the unique needs of your team.

-   How to leverage the web platform to work more efficiently and effectively.
-   How to write code that can more easily be reused across projects.
-   How to more easily pick up other peoples code, and write code that other team members can easily work on.
-   How to write code that scales with projects.
-   How to use build tools to automate repetitive tasks.
-   How to reduce load on backend.
-   How to create apps that continue to work even when things break.
-   How to do more, more quickly, with fewer resources.

Training can be customized to the needs of your team, and include a mix of asynchronous learning, project-based workshops, and group mentoring via chat.

A maximum of 10 students per session is permitted. Sessions  _cannot_  be recorded or distributed beyond the participant group.

## Development Work

### Assets

You are responsible for providing any required assets, including but not limited to written content, images, videos, and designs.

It’s your responsibility to ensure that all content you provide will either be created by you or lawfully obtained by you, meaning that you have permission to use and publish the content on the website without limitation. I will have no responsibility for any unauthorized use or misappropriation of any words, phrases, pictures, videos, images, or other content on the website.

You agree to fully indemnify and hold harmless the Consultant, to the full extent of any and all claims, actions, damages, losses, costs and fees arising from your unauthorized use or misappropriation of any content.

### Supported browsers and devices

My goal is not to make websites look and work the same on every device and browser, but rather to provide an experience that’s appropriate for the capabilities of each browser and device.

I make a distinction between “support” and “optimization.” My goal is to support as many devices and environments as humanly possible, but I optimize websites for modern browsers and devices. Optimization for older devices and browsers must be negotiated for as a separate task, if it is necessary.

### Hosting services and technical support

I do not provide hosting services for the code I develop. You are responsible for selecting, paying for, and maintaining any needed hosting solutions and associated services.

While I may give you names of various hosting services, I do not make any promises, warranties or representations regarding the quality or delivery of such services, and I will not be responsible for any loss, damage, or other adverse consequences related to failures or limitations of the hosting provider. I have personal preferences but I do not have a business relationship with any service provider and I am not paid by anyone to recommend them. 

### Copyrights

I will be providing you with code that you can build upon even after you stop using my services.

I will own the unique combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other code I produce. I’ll license it to you exclusively and in perpetuity for this project only.

I love to show off my work and share what we’ve learned with other people, so I reserve the right, with your permission, to display and link to your project as part of my portfolio and to write about it on websites, in magazine articles, and in books.

## Eligibility

There are certain industries and organizations I just won’t do business with, including but not limited to…

-   Right wing political organizations
-   Illegal products and services
-   Products and services that infringe intellectual property rights
-   Products and services that are unfair, predatory, or deceptive
-   Multi-level marketing, pyramid schemes, and related businesses

If I decide not to continue work with you, you will receive a full refund for the most recently-paid invoice.

## The fine print

### Canceling Services

You or I can cancel my services at any time.

I will continue to provide services for the remainder of the current billing period or provide a refund for the last invoice (at my discretion).

A refund also revokes the license for any services rendered during that time.

### No promises regarding business results

I do not make any promises, warranties, or representations relative to how our services will impact your business, including but not limited to the amount of internet traffic, inquiries, clients and revenues you receive after launch of the website.

### Legal action

These Terms subject to, and shall be interpreted and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York in all respects without regard to conflict of law principles. The Courts of Erie County, New York  shall be the sole and exclusive Courts in which either party may attempt to enforce or establish the existence or scope of any rights, benefits or obligations under this Agreement.

### Costs and fees regarding enforcement

In the event you breach these Terms in any respect, you shall be responsible for all reasonable costs and fees, of whatever nature and kind and including all reasonable attorneys’ fees, incurred by us relative to the breach, regardless of whether any legal action is filed.

### Waiver

You agree that I shall not be deemed to have waived any provision or right under these Terms unless I, Meredith Matthews, signs a document stating that a particular provision or right is being “waived.”

Under no circumstances shall our course of dealing with you constitute any type of waiver, absent the required signed writing. These Terms cannot be amended or modified verbally.

### Complete Agreement

These Terms represents the full and complete understanding between the parties, and it supersedes any and all prior and contemporaneous understandings, representations and communications. You understand and agree that I’m are not making any promises, representations, or warranties regarding the services other than those expressly set forth in this Agreement.

### Severability

If any portion of these Terms is determined by a Court of to be against public policy, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that determination shall not invalidate or otherwise render unenforceable any other provision of these Terms, and the remainder of the Agreement shall remain enforceable.
